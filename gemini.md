# Gemini Project Roadmap: Evolving into a Smarter, Agentic Application

## Phase 4: Interactive & Feature-Rich Landing Page

*   **Objective:** Transform the static landing page into a dynamic and interactive showcase of the application's features.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Interactive Demos:** Embed interactive components that allow users to experience the app's core functionalities directly on the landing page.
    *   **Feature Sections:** Create dedicated sections for each key feature, using a mix of text, high-quality screenshots, and short video demonstrations.
    *   **Animated Illustrations:** Use subtle animations and illustrations to explain complex features in an easy-to-understand manner.
    *   **Testimonials & Social Proof:** Integrate a section for user testimonials and social proof to build trust and credibility.
    *   **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):** Strategically place CTAs throughout the page to guide users towards signing up or trying the app.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the landing page is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

This document outlines the strategic changes and features required to elevate the current application into a more intelligent, agentic, and user-friendly tool with a best-in-class UI/UX inspired by modern, efficient applications like Cato.

## Phase 1: UI/UX Modernization (The "Cato" Initiative)

The goal of this phase is to create a cleaner, faster, and more intuitive user interface that prioritizes user workflow and efficiency.

- **1. Implement Global Command Palette (âŒ˜+K):**
  - Leverage the existing `src/components/ui/command.tsx` to build a global command palette.
  - Users should be able to trigger any major action from this palette (e.g., "New Article", "Start Chat", "Fine-tune Model", "Toggle Theme").
  - This will be the central hub for all user interactions, promoting a keyboard-first workflow.

- **2. Refine Design System & Layout:**
  - **Colors:** Evolve the Tailwind CSS color palette to be more minimalist and professional. Introduce a polished dark mode and light mode.
  - **Typography:** Standardize font sizes, weights, and spacing to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
  - **Layout:** Redesign the main application layout. Consider a collapsible `Sidebar` (using `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`) for navigation and a focused central pane for the `Editor` or `ChatDialog`.

- **3. Enhance Component Interactions:**
  - Add subtle animations and transitions to UI elements to make the app feel more responsive and modern.
  - Ensure all components are fully accessible and navigable via keyboard shortcuts.

## Phase 2: Architecting a More Agentic AI

This phase focuses on moving from single-purpose AI functions to a cohesive, multi-talented agent that can reason, plan, and use tools.

- **1. Develop an AI Orchestrator (Agent Core):**
  - Create a new, central Supabase function (e.g., `ai-agent`) that acts as the main brain.
  - This orchestrator will receive user prompts, break them down into multi-step plans, and execute them.

- **2. Enable Tool-Usage for the Agent:**
  - Refactor the existing Supabase functions (`ai-chat`, `ai-generate-article`, `ai-research`, `humanize-text`) to be "tools" that the main `ai-agent` can call.
  - The agent will decide which tool is appropriate based on the user's request. For example, a request to "research and write an article about X" would first trigger the `ai-research` tool and then feed the results to the `ai-generate-article` tool.

- **3. Implement Chain-of-Thought and Planning:**
  - The agent's thought process should be streamed to the UI.
  - The user should be able to see the agent's plan, which tools it's using, and the results of each step in real-time. This makes the AI's actions transparent and controllable.

- **4. Introduce Agent State Management:**
  - Implement a mechanism (e.g., a new Supabase table) for the agent to maintain state and memory across long-running tasks.
  - This allows the agent to work on complex projects over time, remembering context and previous actions.

## Phase 3: Smarter AI & Advanced Features

This phase builds on the new agentic architecture to introduce more powerful capabilities and quality-of-life improvements.

- **1. Expand Agent's Toolset:**
  - **Web Browsing:** Give the agent the ability to browse the live web to get up-to-date information for research tasks.
  - **File System Access:** Allow the agent to read from and write to a sandboxed file system (e.g., for drafting multiple documents, reading user-uploaded files).

- **2. Proactive & Goal-Oriented AI:**
  - Evolve the agent from a reactive tool to a proactive assistant.
  - The agent should be able to take a high-level goal (e.g., "Help me launch my new product") and autonomously generate and execute a plan to achieve it (e.g., draft marketing copy, suggest social media posts, outline a launch strategy).

- **3. Deep Fine-Tuning Integration:**
  - Make the `FineTuningPanel` more intuitive.
  - The agent should be able to automatically suggest when a fine-tuned model might be beneficial and guide the user through the process of creating one.
  - The agent should also be smart enough to automatically route future queries to the most appropriate fine-tuned model.

- **4. Implement Document Version History & Collaboration:**
  - Add a version history feature to the `Editor`, allowing users to view and revert to previous versions of their work.
  - Explore adding real-time collaborative editing capabilities.
